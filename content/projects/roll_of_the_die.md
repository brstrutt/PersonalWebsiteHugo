## Roll the Die

This is a game produced during GMTK Game Jam 2022 as an excuse to mess around with building web games using Rust.

To play the game simply click it below and use the Arrow Keys!

## How was this built?

After stumbling around in the dark for a few hours I found out about a small game engine for Rust called [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org). The main selling point for me was Bevy's ability to build for a WASM target natively. This made life MUCH easier than I expected.

The only other tool I really needed (other than the standard Rust toolchain) was Trunk for handling building and running a small web server for testing.

I have to stop writing this now but if you hit up [The Repo](https://github.com/brstrutt/Roll-of-the-Die) you can see the source and there should be some basic build/run instructions if you want them.
