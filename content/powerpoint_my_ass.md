### His eyes

They constantly laser.{{< image_inline "images/powerpoint_my_ass/cyclops_lasering.jpg" >}}

{{% heavy_fragment %}} The laser gets blocked by: {{% /heavy_fragment %}}

{{% heavy_fragment %}} red tinted glass {{% /heavy_fragment %}}
{{% heavy_fragment %}} his eyelids {{% /heavy_fragment %}}

{{% heavy_fragment %}} He wears a red tinted visor he can slide out of the way when he wants to zap something. {{% /heavy_fragment %}}

#### The Problem

He has to TOUCH his FACE to LASERBEAM?

What is this the stoneage?

This is ALWAYS a problem. Every bloody scene the bad guys trap his hand and he's suddenly completely useless.

---

#### The Solution

Give the guy a fucking red monacle, so he can see.

Then he can just OPEN AND CLOSE HIS OTHER EYE.

HANDS FREE.

SO EASY.

JUST DO IT.

---

### His Name

His name is Cyclops

The man has TWO EYES

I rest my case

(just call him Gazerbeam like in the Incredibles that's such a damn good name)

## Suncream is a scam

It's sticky, you need to re-apply it CONSTANTLY

APPARENTLY NOBODY USES ENOUGH OF IT OR REAPPLIES IT OFTEN ENOUGH ALREADY

It's a consumable you have to constantly buy more of.

How much goddamn plastic waste out there is just suncream bottles.

Just wear big clothes!

Reusable

Don't need to constantly re-apply

Not sticky

It's worked for fucking millenia we don't need a subscription to SPF-cum

## The Sun is a Sky Bastard

SHUT UP IT IS

- sunburn
- blindness
- making things TOO DAMN HOT

The sun is a bastard

If an old man broke into your house, set fire to your arms, stabbed your eyes out, and doused you in GREASE every day, you wouldn't worship him for putting fresh milk in the fridge you'd tell him to fuck off.

## Computers CAN divide by zero they just HATE YOU

divide by zero has no answer it's an invalid operation

LOOK AT THIS FUCKING GRAPH THE ANSWER IS SO OBVIOUS

SO OBVIOUS THAT THE IEEE 754 STANDARD FOR FLOATING POINT MATHEMATICS EXPLICITLY LISTS INFINITY AS THE RESULT OF A DIVIDE BY ZERO

Computers need to stop SHITTING THE BED just because you DARED divide one number by another number

JUST RETURN INFINITY

## Fist the Pringles Can (gently)

Tipping the pringles can means the perfect stack gets fucked up. Pringles fall down the side of the stack and get stuck. You gotta smash em to get em out. Absolute nonsense.

Just slide your hand in and grab the pringles with your finger tippy tips.

(you can do it. Bo Burnham is just communist propaganda)
