## Ingredients

- Chicken Breast Fillet
- Bacon
- Cheddar
- BBQ sauce

## Recipe

- Wrap the bacon around the Chicken fillet
- Place on a baking tray and follow the cooking instructions for the fillet (typically 30 mins at 200c)
- Slice the cheddar into reasonably thick slices
- 2 minutes before the chicken is ready, place the cheddar chunks on top and add the bbq sauce to the top of the cheddar
- Put back in the oven until the the cheddar has melted just enough for the bbq sauce to sink in

## Notes

- Need to play with cheddar/bbq sauce quantities and times to get it just right.
