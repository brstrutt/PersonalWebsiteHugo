## Ingredients

- 75g choc bar (chopped) - Note: I recommend White Chocolate. Makes the Brownie Lighter but still gooooood
- 100g butter
- 130g sugar
- 2 eggs
- 40g flour
- 35g cocoa powder

## Recipe

- melt chocolate, butter, and 1/3rd of the cocoa
- mix the eggs with the sugar whisking real hard for a decent amount of time
- pour the melted chocolate into the egg/sugar mix
- sift the flour and remaining cocoa into the mix and FOLD in
- pour into a parchment paper lined baking tray
- bake at 180 for 20 mins, bang on counter, bake for 20 more mins, wait to cool, slice

## Misc notes

- These quantities fill one small baking tray
- One baking tray is PLENTY of brownie
- If yo parchment paper is LEANING IN to the baking tray, you gonna wanna sort that shit OUT before you start pouring. It ain't gonna fix itself, and it's probably gonna fuck everything up during pouring.
- Muscavado sugar may be fancy, but is NOT a good replacement for regular sugar
