## Ingredients

- oil enough to keep onion/carrot stuff moist whilst frying
- 500g minced beef
- 2 onion
- 3 carrot
- 4 tbsp tomato puree (or more....I always use MORE)
- 2 tin plum tomatoes

## Recipe

- chop the carrot and onion very small/thin
- fry in olive oil for 15 minutes on medium/high heat stirring regularly
- Add the beef and stir in, letting it fry for like 10 minutes
- Add the tomato puree and plum tomatoes and basil and salt and mix it alllll in
- Swirl some water around the inside of the tomato cans and add that to the mix. Put the lid on and drop the heat to medium
- Let it simmer in periods of 10 minutes with the lid on. Check after each ten minute timer until it gets pretty close to NOT being watery...then start the carbs (rice/spaghet/noodle/toast/whatever you want)

## Notes

- Normal saucepan is not big enough for 1000g of mince plus everything else
