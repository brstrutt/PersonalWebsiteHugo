## Ingredients

- 1 Onion
- 500g Mince
- 1 Beaten egg
- (Option) 1 chunk of Cheddar per burger

## Recipe

- Finely chop and fry the onion for like 10 mins until golden, then set aside for later
- Combine the mince with the egg in a bowl, season, then add the onion
- Shape the burgers (Optionally embed one chunk of cheddar in the centre of each burger)
- Put the burgers in the fridge for half an hour to firm up
- Cook them in a frying pan

## Notes

- 1 egg for 250g of mince is a bit too much I'm thinking
- Was a tad  bland. I'ma blame the pork + beef mince for that. Probably shoulda used pure beef
- Also the cheese was bland. Maybe embedding the cheese block is a bad idea.
