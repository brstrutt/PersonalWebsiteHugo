## Ingredients

- 1 garlic clove
- 35G unsalted butter
- 2 chicken fillets

- breadcrumbs

## Recipe

- Mash up the garlic real good (smash, slice, bash with salt)
- mash with the butter using a fork
- wrap tightly in clingfilm to form 2 sausage things and put them in the freezer for 15 mins to firm up
- Flatten the chicken real good
- Slice garlic butter logs thinly
- wrap the garlic butter slices in the chicken, put seam down on a plate and put in fridge for like 10 mins
- dip chicken thingies into flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs
- put seam down on baking tray and drizzle in oil
- Cook for 25 minutes

## Notes

- Wasnt enough garlic butter in the chickens. maybe make more and dont slice
- Struggled to wrap the garlic, poound the chicken thinner?
- didn't brown because not fried on both sides. fry next time before baking?
