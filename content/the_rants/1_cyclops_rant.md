#### The Problem

He has to TOUCH his FACE to LASERBEAM?

What is this the stoneage?

This is ALWAYS a problem. Every bloody scene the bad guys trap his hand and he's suddenly completely useless.

---

#### The Solution

Give the guy a fucking red monacle, so he can see.

Then he can just OPEN AND CLOSE HIS OTHER EYE.

HANDS FREE.

SO EASY.

JUST DO IT.

### His Name

His name is Cyclops

The man has TWO EYES

I rest my case

(just call him Gazerbeam like in the Incredibles that's such a damn good name)
