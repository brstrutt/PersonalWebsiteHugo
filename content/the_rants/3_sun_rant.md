## Why?

Because it hates each and every one of us

- blindness
- making things TOO DAMN HOT

The sun is a bastard

## More on blindness

I used to walk to work

So I got the JOY of dealing with low-horizon sun for half an hour

It blinds you from the front

It reflects off every goddamn metal/wet surface to blind you from the side

You put it behind you but NOOOO it STILL BLINDS YOU by reflecting off your OWN DAMN GLASSES

If an old man broke into your house, set fire to your arms, stabbed your eyes out, and doused you in GREASE every day, you wouldn't worship him for putting fresh milk in the fridge you'd tell him to fuck off.

## The solution

It's big and shit and needs to fuck off

We need more clouds or something
