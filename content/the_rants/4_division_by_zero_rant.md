## Computers CAN divide by zero they just HATE YOU

divide by zero has no answer it's an invalid operation

LOOK AT THIS FUCKING GRAPH THE ANSWER IS SO OBVIOUS

SO OBVIOUS THAT THE IEEE 754 STANDARD FOR FLOATING POINT MATHEMATICS EXPLICITLY LISTS INFINITY AS THE RESULT OF A DIVIDE BY ZERO

Computers need to stop SHITTING THE BED just because you DARED divide one number by another number

JUST RETURN INFINITY
