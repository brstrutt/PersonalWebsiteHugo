## Fist the Pringles Can (gently)

Tipping the pringles can means the perfect stack gets fucked up. Pringles fall down the side of the stack and get stuck. You gotta smash em to get em out. Absolute nonsense.

Just slide your hand in and grab the pringles with your finger tippy tips.

(you can do it. Bo Burnham is just communist propaganda)
