## Suncream is a scam

It's sticky, you need to re-apply it CONSTANTLY

APPARENTLY NOBODY USES ENOUGH OF IT OR REAPPLIES IT OFTEN ENOUGH ALREADY

It's a consumable you have to constantly buy more of.

How much goddamn plastic waste out there is just suncream bottles.

Just wear big clothes!

Reusable

Don't need to constantly re-apply

Not sticky

It's worked for fucking millenia we don't need a subscription to SPF-cum
