## Payday 3: Skill Experience

I noticed I seem to be gaining experience in every skill tree I have a card selected in.
I think this is worth investigating.

Here are some rough notes looking into it.

### Test 1: Baseline

I will complete a heist with just one skill selected to see how the experience gets divided.
Skills:

- Medic Basic

Researching: Engineer
Heist: Road Rage - Normal

Result:

- 300xp into Medic Tree
- Unlocked Engineer

### Test 2: Much investment

This test is to see how distributing my points will affect experience gain.
Skills:

- Engineer Aced
- Mower Basic, Recoil Handling Basic

Researching: Strategist
Heist: Road Rage - Normal

Result:

- 300xp into Strategist Tree
- 300xp into Engineer Tree
- Unlocked Suppressive fire

### Test 3: Varying Investment

This test is to see if having one point in one tree and three in another has any effect
Skills:

- Medic Basic
- Mower Basic, Recoil Handling Basic, Suppressive Fire Basic

Researching: Strategist
Heist: Road Rage - Normal

Result:

- 300xp into Mower tree
- Unlocked Steady Hands
- Unlocked Strategist

## Conclusions

You get experience for every skill tree you have active.

You get the same experience per tree regardless of how many points you put into that tree.

You get the same experience per tree regardless of how many trees you have active.

If you have points in only one tree and get 300 exp, you would have got 300 exp for every tree you have points in.

This means to max skill gain you need to spread your points across as many trees as you can. Every new tree with a point in it is an EXTRA 300 exp.
