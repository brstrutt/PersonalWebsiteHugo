## Fist the Pringles Can (gently)

---

{{< slide background="#161" >}}

## Standard procedure

Tip the can so the pringles slide/fall towards the opening

---

{{< slide background="#161" >}}

## The problem

This fucks up the stack

Pringles fall down the side

Some get stuck and need to be smashed to get the rest out

Waste of a pringle right there

## The solution

Keep the can upright

Just slide your hand in and grab some with your fingertips

The stack stays perfectly aligned

No Pringles need to be sacrificed

(you can do it. I believe in you. Bo Burnham is just communist propaganda)
