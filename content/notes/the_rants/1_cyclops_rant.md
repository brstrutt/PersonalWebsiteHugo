## Background

Cyclops is the laser eye man from XMEN

His eyes are always shooting lasers

He can't turn them off, only block them

His eyelids block them

So do his red glasses

## His visor

His costume includes a visor that lets him block/unblock the laserbeams

He can block/unblock the lasers using a lever on the side of the visor

## The problem

The guy with LASER EYES becomes USELESS if his HANDS ARE BUSY

Is this the STONEAGE?

You defeat this guy with HANDCUFFS!
Rope!

Ask him to carry your bags and he's DEFENCELESS

## The Solution

He needs a hands-free way to turn the laser on and off

Some magic way to block/unblock the beams without needing to touch his face

Something like....

### HIS FUCKING EYELIDS

---

{{< slide background="#123" >}}

Give him a red monocle so he can use one eye to see his way around

Then if he ever needs a laserbeam he can just OPEN HIS OTHER EYE

HANDS FREE

SO EASY

JUST DO IT

### I also hate his name

His name is Cyclops

The man has TWO EYES

I rest my case

(just call him Gazerbeam like in the Incredibles that's such a damn good name)
