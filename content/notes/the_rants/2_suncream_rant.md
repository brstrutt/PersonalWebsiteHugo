## Suncream is a scam

---

{{< slide background="#CA8" >}}

## The downsides

It's sticky

You need to re-apply it every hour

You need to put on even more than you already do (statistically)

You need to KEEP BUYING IT because it RUNS OUT

Which also means you're constantly throwing away plastic packaging

## The solution

## BIG CLOTHES

---

{{< slide background="#CA8" >}}

You buy them ONCE

You just...wear them

No re-applying

No "you didn't put on enough"

No STICKY

It's worked for fucking millenia we don't need a summer subscription to SPF-cum
