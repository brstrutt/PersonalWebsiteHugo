      <description>Safehouse Nightmare: A shallow diveSo apparently completing everything at Mayhem difficulty INCLUDES safehouse nightmare. Whose idea was that? Anyway here&amp;rsquo;s a braindump of info about safehouse nightmare followed by some (probably trash tier) builds. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to read I can confirm that as of like Feb 2023 the turret cheese strat still works. If you want a cakewalk, do that.
The HeistThe main gimmick of this heist is that you have to survive for 6 minutes while being assaulted by Cloakers and Headless Bulldozers.</description>
