      <description>Safehouse Nightmare: A shallow diveSo apparently completing everything at Mayhem difficulty INCLUDES safehouse nightmare. Whose idea was that? Anyway here&amp;rsquo;s a braindump of info about safehouse nightmare followed by some (probably trash tier) builds. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to read I can confirm that as of like Feb 2023 the turret cheese strat still works. If you want a cakewalk, do that.
The HeistThe main gimmick of this heist is that you have to survive for 6 minutes while being assaulted by Cloakers and Headless Bulldozers.</description>

      <description>Roll the DieThis is a game produced during GMTK Game Jam 2022 as an excuse to mess around with building web games using Rust.
To play the game simply click it below and use the Arrow Keys!
playable embedded version currently down for maintenance How was this built?After stumbling around in the dark for a few hours I found out about a small game engine for Rust called Bevy. The main selling point for me was Bevy&amp;rsquo;s ability to build for a WASM target natively.</description>

      <description>First Turn Kill (Almost) All Bosses in Bravely Default 2So while playing Bravely Default 2 I accidentally a build that can first turn kill most endgame bosses. This was not the plan, and it trivialised the endgame to the same extent as if I&amp;rsquo;d just hacked in an infinite damage attack. Ooops. On the upside I&amp;rsquo;m kinda proud of the build so I decided to write this post explaining what it is and how it works.</description>

      <description>Controlling Dark Souls with a Piano? But Why?So i&amp;rsquo;ve had this midi piano keyboard for a while now but I don&amp;rsquo;t use it all that much. This project was intended to give me an excuse to use the keyboard more, with the hope being that it could help make me better at hitting specific notes or maybe even CHORDS. It didn&amp;rsquo;t quite pan out that way as I played for like half an hour and then gave up but it&amp;rsquo;s the thought that counts!</description>
