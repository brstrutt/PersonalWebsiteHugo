        <h1>Safehouse Nightmare</h1>
        </section>
<section class="section2">
<h2>Safehouse Nightmare: A shallow dive</h2><p>So apparently completing everything at Mayhem difficulty INCLUDES safehouse nightmare. Whose idea was that? Anyway here&rsquo;s a braindump of info about safehouse nightmare followed by some (probably trash tier) builds.
If you don&rsquo;t want to read I can confirm that as of like Feb 2023 the turret cheese strat still works. If you want a cakewalk, do that.</p>
</section>
<section class="section2">
<h2>The Heist</h2><p>The main gimmick of this heist is that you have to survive for 6 minutes while being assaulted by Cloakers and Headless Bulldozers. The heist takes place in a very dark basement, only letting you out once the safe has finished drilling. You will need to leave the basement to get to the loot drop point, then escape by going to bed. Note the escape is NOT NEXT TO THE VAN.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Objectives</h3><ul>
<li>Drill the big safe</li>
<li>Survive for 6 minutes</li>
<li>Secure 4 bags of money</li>
<li>Escape</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Random Elements</h3><p>Upon starting the drill a selection of random effects will start. The possible effects are as follows:</p>
</section>
<section class="section4">
<h4>Dangerous</h4><ul>
<li>Jumping will taze you</li>
<li>Pumpkins periodically appear and then explode</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="section4">
<h4>Cosmetic</h4><ul>
<li>Everything is on fire</li>
<li>Everything is foggy</li>
<li>Your screen regularly goes black for about a second</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Map</h3><p>
<img src = "/images/safehouse_nightmare/Map_Basement.jpg" alt = "Safehouse Nightmare Basement Map" style = "max-width: 100%"/>
</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Other</h3><ul>
<li>The heist won&rsquo;t properly &ldquo;start&rdquo; until the big drill is started, so you have plenty of time to setup whatever you want to.</li>
<li>Sometimes a baby mask will appear. If you pick this up it&rsquo;ll probably down you, so maybe don&rsquo;t do that.</li>
<li>Drilling the small safes won&rsquo;t start the heist, but also these safes don&rsquo;t have anything useful/worthwhile in them.</li>
<li>The walls are made of Shields. Anything that pierces a shield will go straight through the walls.</li>
<li>You cannot take any hostages or convert any cops on this map.</li>
<li>Being next to a spawn point will not stop enemies spawning there.</li>
<li>The upstairs area will not open until the main drill has finished.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="section2">
<h2>Enemies</h2><p>A quick overview of the two enemies you need to deal with.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Headless Bulldozer</h3><p>Bullet sponge. Think regular dozer but with no head. Yes you&rsquo;ll probably need to bodyshot it to death. Luckily it has less health than regular dozers, but it&rsquo;s still pretty chonky.</p>
<ul>
<li>12,000 HP (Mayhem, Deathwish, Death Sentence)</li>
<li>TINY headshot hitbox</li>
<li>Headshot multiplier is X2 (Mayhem), X1.5 (Deathwish, Death Sentence)</li>
<li>Has a shield on his back, just to make life harder</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Cloaker</h3><p>Standard cloaker. It&rsquo;ll kick ya. Honestly if you can kill the dozers you can kill these guys. Just remember you&rsquo;ll want something you can shoot quickly at close range to deal with them.</p>
<ul>
<li>3,600 HP (Mayhem, Deathwish, Death Sentence)</li>
<li>Get kicked idiot</li>
<li>Headshot multiplier is X12 (Mayhem), X9 (Deathwish, Death Sentence)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Scientist</h3><p>Occasionally a horde of scientists will appear and sprint for the metal detector to leave.</p>
<ul>
<li>Insignificant HP</li>
<li>Civilians</li>
<li>Cannot be cable tied</li>
<li>Might trigger trip mines&hellip;</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="section2">
<h2>Useful Items</h2><p>A small selection of items (mostly weapons) that are good on this one map specifically.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>PNV - BriteNite 

<img src=/images/safehouse_nightmare/BriteNite_hud51b2ac54c2ac3cc527be537a8ddd31f_5157_0x50_resize_q75_box.jpg alt=BriteNite class="sameHeightAsText"/>/Batshit Crazy 

<img src=/images/safehouse_nightmare/batshit-crazy_huaccc4278ee8fd35423dbd4a00e4217f3_5007_0x50_resize_q75_box.jpg alt=Batshit&#32;Crazy class="sameHeightAsText"/>/Cloaker-san 

<img src=/images/safehouse_nightmare/cloaker-san_hu16ae5a1dec20e3cc0015657b11039d7b_3518_0x50_resize_q75_box.jpg alt=cloaker-san class="sameHeightAsText"/></h3><p>These masks (found in mask category Normal/DLC/Normal) have inbuilt night vision, turned on/off by holding V for a few seconds. Solves the &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very dark down here&rdquo; problem this heist has.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Ammo Bags 

<img src=/images/safehouse_nightmare/Ammobag-icon_hue88e4d1216628246874ce40b9d10fcf5_11310_0x50_resize_box_3.png alt=Ammo&#32;Bag class="sameHeightAsText"/></h3><p>This heist WILL drain your ammo. I don&rsquo;t care what gun you bring, you will not have enough ammo to take out 6 minutes of dozers and cloakers. An ammo bag is required.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Akimbo Parabellum Pistols 

<img src=/images/safehouse_nightmare/Akimbo_Parabellum_FBI_Files_hu51673e6ed09154cdcade941068026daf_14443_0x50_resize_box_3.png alt=Akimbo&#32;Parabellum class="sameHeightAsText"/></h3><p>These pistols are very good at taking down Dozers. Hight concealment lets you go for crits. Comboed with Pistol skills makes them pretty damn effective.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>5/7 AP Pistol 

<img src=/images/safehouse_nightmare/57AP_FBI_Files_hua1510198fe4d4a9e5e6ad8af43294e73_9116_0x50_resize_box_3.png alt=5/7&#32;AP&#32;Pistol class="sameHeightAsText"/></h3><p>Like the parabellums, this has high concealment for crits and benefits from pistol skills. Whilst it is MUCH slower at killing dozers than the parabellums, THIS PISTOL CAN SHOOT THROUGH THE WALLS. Taking out anything from the other side of a wall will be slower but safer than facing them down head on.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>HRL-7 Rocket Launcher 

<img src=/images/safehouse_nightmare/HRL-7_FBI_Files_huc975e0dd0e2cd80fa63f865bd8ea998e_10771_0x50_resize_box_3.png alt=HRL-7&#32;Rocket&#32;Launcher class="sameHeightAsText"/></h3><p>This will one shot the dozers with a direct hit, and will two shot them with indirect hits (catching them in the explosion).</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Commando 101 Rocket Launcher 

<img src=/images/safehouse_nightmare/Commando_101_FBI_Files_hu4cff33291c06cb9c0b935b436bbd793e_21939_0x50_resize_box_3.png alt=Commando&#32;101 class="sameHeightAsText"/></h3><p>This will two shot dozers on direct and indirect hits.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Trip Mines 

<img src=/images/safehouse_nightmare/Tripmine-icon_huaee9cdc661b10d2c1e81444cf11250e3_8055_0x50_resize_box_3.png alt=Trip&#32;Mines class="sameHeightAsText"/></h3><p>These will ALSO one shot dozers when buffed with Technician skill Combat Engineering Aced. Also useful in sensor mode for letting you know where all the enemies are, making it easier to take them out through walls.</p>
</section>
<section class="section2">
<h2>Un-useful Items</h2><p>Some items seem like they may work, but they in fact do NOT. Here are some of those.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Thanatos</h3><p>Useful in theory, in practice it&rsquo;s almost impossible to get their damage high enough to one shot kill dozers on a body shot. Seriously, you&rsquo;d need to stack Berzerker, Crits, High Value Target, AND Overkill and even THAT might not work.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Melee</h3><p>You&rsquo;d be forced to use Sociopath or Infiltrator perk decks, and then stand at point blank range for two seconds to take out a dozer. This does not an alive heister make.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Flamethrowers</h3><p>I tried it. It did not appear to slow them down at ALL. I didn&rsquo;t see ANY stopping/flailing to put the fire out. Don&rsquo;t bother.</p>
</section>
<section class="section2">
<h2>Strats</h2><p>So here&rsquo;s where I just list some things that might work/help. They won&rsquo;t be fully fledged point by point &ldquo;heres how you win&rdquo; descriptors. I haven&rsquo;t won yet so I can&rsquo;t really do that. Honestly I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;d trust ANYTHING I say I haven&rsquo;t beaten this mission on anything higher than overkill.</p>
<p>Oh also they will be assuming you have a 4 man squad. If you just have a you, try <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1350201448">this</a> build. It did NOT work in a team of 4 because it relies HEAVILY on 3 AI crew with Thanatos sniper rifles.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>C4 Lockdown</h3><p>The idea here is, what if we just put C4 on every spawn point, and replace every one that goes off? I haven&rsquo;t found ALL the spawn points, but have found most and there seem to be roughly 14 of them, which lines up well with the 14 trip mines you get if you ace Combat Engineering&rsquo;s More Firepower. With a team of 4 all carrying max trip mines you may be able to spawn kill everything for six minutes then book it.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>C4 Web</h3><p>This idea is just to put C4 all over the place in sensor mode. Highlighting eveyrthing on the map might be VERY useful for you. Or it might be a waste of points.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Walls? What walls?</h3><p>If you have a sniper rifle, shotgun, or the 5/7 AP Pistol you can shoot through the walls. The idea here is simple, you hide behind the walls, and shoot through them to kill everything without putting yourself in danger.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Teamkiller Extraordinaire</h3><p>Explosions are just the best way to kill dozers. And also everybody else. Just bring the biggest explosions you have, probably grab Swan Song Aced, and just go ham. Probably good at clearing crowds at range. Might also just kill the whole team. I&rsquo;d probably lean towards the Commando rocket launcher, Ammo bags with bulletstorm, Aced Swan Song, and at least ONE Leech with Inspire to clutch revive the team when you inevitably kill EVERYONE.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Dice King</h3><p>Hey so you know how this heist has certain random effects? You could just restart the heist until it doesn&rsquo;t have exploding pumpkins/your screen going black every few seconds. Also you can restart until you roll an auto-restarting drill to make life MUCH easier.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Git Gud</h3><p>This one is basically, try and do what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRBOajZwmQM">this guy</a> did. Basically, use a Berzerker/Anarchist meta build with ammo bags. I&rsquo;ve stolen some ideas from it for this &ldquo;guide&rdquo;, but yeah this needs skill to work so I can&rsquo;t pull it off.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Diversity</h3><p>This is basically just &ldquo;what we had different party members with different skills&rdquo;. Yes, this is probably the way to go. Ideally you&rsquo;ll have a drill guy who has really good drills, someone with ammo bags, someone with doctors bags, someone with inspire, someone who can deal with single targets, someone to take out crowds. Basically see how many of the above strats you can cram into one team. Apes together strong.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Cheese</h3><p>Oh yeah also there was at one point a sentry cheese where you put down a loud sentry somewhere impossible to get to, and all the enemies would just gather around it. I wonder if that still works? Anyway <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJ-vKRhHXUk">here</a> is the video.</p>
</section>
<section class="section2">
<h2>Builds</h2><p>Here are a few PARTIAL builds. These are just pieces that you can put together to form your own build, because screw trying to create 4 full builds I&rsquo;ve already put WAY too much time into this.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Pistol Damage</h3><p><a href="https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=0-90-90-4M9xu00gF">This</a> is a build focused purely on getting damage out of pistols. Specifically the Akimbo Parabellums. If you need to drop points I&rsquo;d personally start by dropping the berzerker skills, then move onto Desperado, then remove Ace from Gun Nut.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>Techy</h3><p><a href="https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=0-901k380v0-900h00">This</a> build is for the equipment owner. Drill skills, ammo, and C4 are the focus. Probably bring a Commando 101 rocket launcher and&hellip;.something else as weapons. For a perk deck go for something objective focused, like Sicario/Kingpin/Leech. Should let you clutch fix the drill. If you want to drop stuff, start by dropping C4/Jack of all trades. Or, if you are getting good use from them, ditch Swan Song.</p>
</section>
<section class="section3">
<h3>The &ldquo;Support&rdquo;</h3><p><a href="https://pd2builder.netlify.app/?s=1Q0-910-9058000V00">This</a> build plus Leech. Take a rocket launcher and just blow things up. Sure you&rsquo;ll down your entire team, but you can inspire them back up again, and can even get YOURSELF back up if you need to! Swap uppers for Doctors Bags if you want to support your team more than yourself. OOh, or even BETTER have two people on the team, one with First Aid Kits and one with Doctors Bags. Then when you decide to be useful, ditch the explosives and drop the revenant skills. Then pick up some pistols instead.</p>
</section>
<section class="section2">
<h2>Sources</h2><p>Here is where I link to verious data sources I used while researching this heist. Honestly, you&rsquo;d probably be better off looking at them yourself than reading my ramblings. There might even be one or two well thought through builds in there!</p>
